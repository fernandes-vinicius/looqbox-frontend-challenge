Welcome to the Looqbox FrontEnd Challenge - Pok√©dex edition! In this challenge,
you will be tasked with building a Single Page Application (SPA) using ReactJS,
Redux, TypeScript, and AntDesign to create a dynamic Pok√©dex utilizing the PokeAPI.

## [Demo](https://looqbox-frontend-challenge-web.vercel.app)

## üìò Challenge Overview

The task is to build a Pok√©dex application that retrieves data from the PokeAPI.
The app should allow users to search for Pok√©mon, view detailed information
about each Pok√©mon and navigate between different routes within the app.

**Main Features**

Here are the main features that the application includes:

- [x] - **Paginated Pok√©mon List**: Implement a Pok√©mon list that allows paginated
browsing, displaying a limited number of Pok√©mon per page for easier navigation.
- [x] - **Dynamic Search**: Provides a search bar that allows users to search
for Pok√©mon by name or code. The Pok√©mon list updates dynamically as the user
types in the search bar.
- [x] - **Pok√©mon Details**: Clicking on a Pok√©mon in the list displays detailed
information about that Pok√©mon, such as image, type, abilities, stats, etc.
- [x] - **Integration with Ant Design**: We used the components provided by Ant Design
to create a consistent and pleasant user interface, ensuring an intuitive and
easy-to-use user experience.
